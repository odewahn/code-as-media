== Code Analysis and Metrics

This section covers services that evaluate a code repo and create ancillary material for it.  For example, a service might compute various metrics (code coverage for a test suite, etc), project management assets (for example, it sends a message to a chat service when someone commits), documentation (rebuilds automated docs on each commit), or other software engineering-related items.  

The tools are often implemented as webhooks within a CI server (Jenkins, etc) or in the underlying version control system.  These services can either be free or paid.  If they're paid, they're typically implemented by having the user register for a paid service and enter some sort of authorization token into the web hook.  <<service_hook>>, for example, shows how  paid service is configured in GitHub's "Service Hooks."

Examples of metrics include:

=== CodeClimate 

https://codeclimate.com/[CodeClimate] provides automated Ruby code review.  You give it a repo by (among other ways) creating a GitHub service hook, and it will give you back some reports.  It's a paid service with a tiered pricing scheme.

=== Documentation Generators

This section covers tools that build documentation directly from the source code itself.  This idea, called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming], was invented by Donald Knuth as a way to create self-documenting programs.  The technique is used by many languages to create reference and API documents and sites. 

Key tools include:

* Sphinx.  Documentation generator for Python.
* JavaDocs.  Documentation for Java.
